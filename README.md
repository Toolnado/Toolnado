## ðŸš€ Projects & Contributions

### Microservices Architecture
I've worked extensively on designing and implementing microservices, ensuring they are scalable, maintainable, and efficient. I thrive on breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable services that communicate seamlessly.

### Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)
I have experience in developing DSLs tailored to specific problem domains, making it easier to express solutions and improve productivity.

### Load Testing
I have hands-on experience in conducting load tests to ensure the reliability and performance of applications under varying levels of stress.

### Unit Testing
I regularly implement unit tests to verify the correctness of code, ensuring that individual units of code work as expected and contribute to the overall stability of the application.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Currently Learning
I'm always looking to expand my skill set and stay updated with the latest in technology. Currently, I'm diving deeper into distributed systems and exploring new paradigms in backend development.
